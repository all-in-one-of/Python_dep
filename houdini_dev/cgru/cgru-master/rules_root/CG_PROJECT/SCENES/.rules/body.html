	Scenes asset shows thumbnail and status information on every project shot.
</p>
<p>
	Thumbnails are generated automatically by Shot asset (it sends such request for server).
	So if some thumbnail presents you can see that somebody started to work with a shot.
</p>
<p>
	Search performed in Scenes asset is very fast, as it is not a server side search, it is just GUI shows/hides shots.
	( Asset can override engine search behaviour. )
</p>
<p>
	This is search example shows all shots with
	<a href="#/CG_PROJECT/SCENES?{%22u_Search%22:{%22tags%22:[%22wirem%22]}}">Wire Removal</a> tag.
	Yes, search state is represented by a link.
	So you can create a complex query and simple copy it to show search results to somebody else.
